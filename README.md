# Excel-for-beginners
I'll be documenting my process of improving my skills on excel here
-----------------------------

I started using Excel for Dta analysis today by creating a Payroll.
While doing this, I learnt how to 
1. Navigate through Spreadsheets
2. Create formulas
3. How to use Absolute and Relative references
4. Saving Excel files in CSV 

I learnt all this from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl0H-qTclOg&t=2379s)
You should check it out too.

See you tomorrow!
